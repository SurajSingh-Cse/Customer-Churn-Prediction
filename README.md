# 📉 Customer Churn Prediction

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques. The goal is to identify customers who are likely to leave a service or company, allowing for proactive retention strategies.

---

## 🚀 Project Objective

To build a machine learning model that can accurately classify customers as "churn" or "not churn" based on their usage behavior, demographics, and service history.

---

## 📂 Dataset Information

- **Source**: [Telco Customer Churn Dataset] (or your own dataset source)
- **Attributes**:
  - Customer ID
  - Gender, SeniorCitizen, Partner, Dependents
  - Tenure, MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges
  - Contract Type, InternetService, PaymentMethod
  - Churn (Target Variable)

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy**
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- (Optional) Streamlit for dashboard or Flask for deployment

---

## 🧪 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Missing value treatment and type conversion
- Univariate & bivariate analysis using Seaborn/Matplotlib
- Correlation matrix to understand important features

---

## ⚙️ Model Building

Models used:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- XGBoost

Metrics:
- Accuracy
- Precision, Recall, F1-score
- ROC AUC Curve

---

## ✅ Results

| Model              | Accuracy | F1 Score |
|-------------------|----------|----------|
| Logistic Regression | 82%     | 0.76     |
| Random Forest       | 86%     | 0.80     |
| XGBoost             | 88%     | 0.82     |

Random Forest and XGBoost performed the best with highest F1 scores.
